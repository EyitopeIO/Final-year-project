# Final-year-project
My final year project for a B.Eng in electrical and electronics engineering is to digitally track medical samples in transit, making information about its state available for medical officers to see. A cooler made of styrofoam is equipped with sensors and necessary electronics to connect it to the internet. 
Main.ino and Homebase.ino should be compiled together. 
Diptrace is the software used to draw the schematic.
